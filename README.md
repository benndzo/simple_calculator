# Tkinter Calculator

A simple and responsive calculator application built with Python's **Tkinter** library. The app provides basic arithmetic operations, a clean user interface, and features like backspace and clear functionality.

## Features
- **Basic Arithmetic:** Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Responsive Layout:** Buttons and entry box adjust to window size dynamically.
- **Clear Button (C):** Clears the entire input.
- **Backspace Button (⌫):** Removes the last entered character.

- **Error Handling:** Displays "Error" for invalid expressions.

## Installation
1. Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or copy the script.

### Dependencies
This app uses only built-in Python libraries, so no additional installation is required.

## How to Run
1. Save the script as `calculator.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt in the script's directory.
3. Run the script using:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```

## Usage
1. Use the number buttons (`0-9`) to input numbers.
2. Use the operator buttons (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) to perform operations.
3. Press `=` to calculate the result.
4. Use:
   - **C:** Clear the entire input.
   - **⌫:** Erase the last character in the input.
   - **.**: Add a decimal point to your number.

### Example
